# Drpster
Drpster is a slick, user friendly, video app that take those elegant, 120 slow-motion, videos that you love.

# Vendor 
SVProgressHUD is a clean and easy-to-use HUD meant to display the progress of an ongoing task.

# Future Updates
Currently Drpster is still in the making, but I have a solid video camera API build and plan to make awesome products with it. Look forward for future projects with this API.
